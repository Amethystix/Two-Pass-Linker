This is the read me file for Lab 1 of Operating Systems.

In this zipped archive, you will find 3 files titled Linker.java, Module.java, and Symbol.java.

To run the Two-Pass Linker project written in Java, you will need to input several things into the command line.

First, with these files in your running directory, input "javac Linker.java"
After it has been compiled, execute the program by typing in "java Linker"
The program will then prompt you to enter the directory of the file you would like to parse for input, type this directory in.
After, the output will be generated in a file called output.txt, and the program will notify you of this.  It should be in your current directory.
